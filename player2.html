    <h1>Lionel Messi</h1>

    <p>
      It’s hard to find the words to describe a man that the football world
      knows simply as ‘The GOAT’. Born in Rosario, the Argentine crossed the
      Atlantic at just 13 years of age to join FC Barcelona. 21 years later, the
      famous left foot has dribbled its way to Paris Saint-Germain, for the
      biggest challenge of his career. In between, ‘Leo’ has scaled all the
      heights. Messi has won 4 Champions League, 10 Liga titles, 7 Copa del Rey,
      6 European Golden Boots, an Olympic gold medal and lifted the Copa America
      with Argentina, just before landing in the French capital. The all-time
      leading goal scorer for his country, the top scorer in the history of
      Spanish football, the top assist provider in the 21st century, Messi has
      broken all the records, but above all, inspired an entire generation of
      footballers around the world with his genius. A living legend, ‘La Pulga’
      has won seven Ballons d’Or, and history will remember his first Paris goal
      in September 2021: a masterpiece of a strike against Manchester City to
      send the Parc delirious.
