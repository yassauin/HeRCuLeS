    Edson Arantes do Nascimento (Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈɛdsõ aˈɾɐ̃tʃiz du nasiˈmẽtu]; 23 October 1940 – 
    29 December 2022), better known by his nickname Pelé (Portuguese pronunciation: [peˈlɛ]), was a Brazilian
     professional footballer who played as a forward. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all
      time, he was among the most successful and popular sports figures of the 20th century.[2][3] In 1999, 
      he was named Athlete of the Century by the International Olympic Committee and was included in the Time
       list of the 100 most important people of the 20th century. In 2000, Pelé was voted World Player of the
        Century by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS) and was one of the 
        two joint winners of the FIFA Player of the Century. His 1,279 goals in 1,363 games, which includes 
        friendlies, is recognised as a Guinness World Record.[4]
